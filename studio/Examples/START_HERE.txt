All of the Example Projects are in ExampleStudio.dsw and fully use the bfc and waclient projects, now.

In order to use any of the example projects on their own, place it, bfc.dsp, and waclient.dsp into a new "myproject.dsw" and you should be able to compile.  Remember to make your project settings link you against the Multithreaded runtime libraries, otherwise you'll go through linker hell.

If you know how to clone projects in VC, we wholeheartedly endorse that behaviour until we get a wizard thing built to help you make wasabi projectfiles (someday, but don't hold your breath).
