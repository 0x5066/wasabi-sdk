Documentation process guidelines
================================

See Documenting Sytle.txt in sdk\docs\ first.


The documentation process will be done in two seperate processes: 

-1- documenting of classes which.
-2- updating header files with new documentation.


Documenting of classes
======================

The documenting of classes will require the use of the SourceOffsite client as well as two basic gnu tools: diff and patch.

How to document:

1. Fetch header (and actual cpp file if necessary)
2. Document class, methods and enum's.
3. Use diff to make a patch against the ORIGINAL header file.
	Rename the patch file to ORIGINAL_HEADER_NAME.h.patch.
4. Everyday, send new patches to Aus or simply ftp to documentation server (to be setup...)

Only completely documented header file patches will be sent. No partially documented header files 
will be updated. This is to avoid loss of sync between sourceoffsite server files and files that are being
documented.

Updating header files
=====================

Updates to the header files to include the documentation (thru the use of patches and patch) will be done on a 
daily basis. Once a day, all the patches produced in that day, will be applied to the source files which will then
be updated on the sourceoffsite server.

There will be a list of files recently patched on the documentation server, as well as the patches that are pending.
(patches that are waiting to be applied ...)

A small note to the core development team, if you add documentation straight into the header while working on a new 
class, please, feel free to check it in at any time =)
